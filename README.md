# Timeline App

## Stage 1 - Static Skeleton with Theme Toggle

This is the initial static skeleton of the Timeline App project, which includes:

- A `<header>` containing the app logo and a theme toggle button for switching between light and dark modes.
- A `<nav>` section reserved for filters and placeholders (currently empty).
- A main content area with a `<section id="timeline">` to hold timeline event markers.
- An empty `<div id="modal">` reserved for future pop-up dialogs.
- Semantic HTML5 structure for better accessibility.
- Basic CSS styling that supports light and dark themes.
- A simple JavaScript snippet enabling the theme toggle button functionality.

### How to use

1. Place the `timeline.png` logo image in the same directory as `index.html`.
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser to view the app skeleton.
3. Click on the "Toggle Theme" button in the header to switch between light and dark themes.

### Next steps

- Add functional event markers inside the timeline section.
- Implement filters inside the navigation area.
- Develop modal pop-ups for detailed event information.
- Enhance styling and responsive design.

This project serves as a foundation for building a timeline visualization app with theme preference support.
